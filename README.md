# rock-paper-scissor
Development Stage 1:
In my first JavaScript project, im going to build a Rock-Paper-Scissor game from scratch - at first without a graphical ui.

Development Stage 2:
This time, its about refining the function of my RPS-Game and adding a functional UI to it.
The RPS-Game will have 3 buttons, one each for rock, paper and scissor.
Also there will be a display, which will show the score for each player in one corner (Player and Computer)
and also show which player won the actual round in the middle of the screen.

Ill try to add a nice theme to the whole game, so that it isnt lame.
